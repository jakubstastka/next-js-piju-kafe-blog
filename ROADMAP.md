# Dev Roadmap for pijukafe.cz coffee blog

What I want to do with the blog. Not necessarily in this order, but likely.

- add a new component for coffee review with basic coffee (WIP)
- add a carousel for blog post detail
- add tags for post and filtering when clicking on those tags
- for content management, use a headless CMS instead of markdown files, call webhooks to generate site when content is published
