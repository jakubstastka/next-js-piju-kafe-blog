# Dev Roadmap for pijukafe.cz coffee blog

What I want to do with the blog. Not necessarily in this order, but likely.

Things already done are listed in the changelog file.

- add another component to render stars as points based on some review system (1-5)
- image slider component should also have dots representing images with highlight of the current one
- somewhere on the page there should be listed and clickable post categories
- blog should have featured posts section
- add pagination on /archive page
- list reviewed roasteries with clickable links to filter coffees by roastery
- for content management, use a headless CMS instead of markdown files
