# Dev Roadmap for pijukafe.cz coffee blog

What I want to do with the blog. Not necessarily in this order, but likely.

Things already done are listed in the changelog file.

- blog index should probably not list all posts, rather have a fixed number and then have a button to list all posts
- add a carousel for blog post detail
- for content management, use a headless CMS instead of markdown files, call webhooks to generate site when content is published
