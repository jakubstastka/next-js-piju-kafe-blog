# piju kafe

My coffee blog created using Next.js, Markdown, and TypeScript.

## Where can I see the site live?

Thank you for your interest. The project lives on [pijukafe.cz](https://pijukafe.cz).

## There is a coffee/coffee-related thing I want you to review!

Great! You can send me coffee related recommendations at [my coffee e-mail](mailto:furt@pijukafe.cz).

## Coffee blog, really, James? Why?

I wanted to learn more about React and Next.js. I decided a blog would be a gret project for that. As the blog grows, there are usually new issues to deal with, so it is a really good long-term project.

Since I don't have many topics to blog about, I decided to launch a coffee blog, since I am interested in coffee.

## Why use Markdown for your posts?

It was convenient at the time. There is a milestone to actually use a headless CMS, but for now I am learning about React, so content management hasn't been much of an issue.
